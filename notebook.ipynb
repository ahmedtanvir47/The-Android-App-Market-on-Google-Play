They are easy to create and can be very lucrative from the business standpoint. Specifically, Android is expanding as an operating system and has captured more than 74% of the total market<sup><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009\">[1]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>The Google Play Store apps data has enormous potential to facilitate data-driven decisions and insights for businesses. In this notebook, we will analyze the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories. We will also use the user reviews to draw a qualitative comparision between the apps.</p>\n<p>The dataset you will use here was scraped from Google Play Store in September 2018 and was published on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps\">Kaggle</a>.

You have been asked to present an analysis of Google Play apps so that the team gets a comprehensive overview of different categories of apps, their ratings, and other metrics.\n\nThis will require you to use your data manipulation and data analysis skills.\n\nYour three questions are as follows:\n\n1. Read the apps.csv file and clean the Installscolumn to convert it into integer data type. Save your answer as a DataFrame apps. Going forward, you will do all your analysis on the apps DataFrame.\n2. Find the number of apps in each category, the average price, and the average rating. Save your answer as a DataFrame app_category_info. Your should rename the four columns as: Category, Number of apps, Average price, Average rating.\n3. Find the top 10 free FINANCE apps having the highest average sentiment score. Save your answer as a DataFrame top_10_user_feedback. Your answer should have exactly 10 rows and two columns named: App and Sentiment Score, where the average Sentiment Score is sorted from highest to lowest.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b75e9307-182e-41ad-af6a-618c1289a4b2"},{"source":"# Use this cell to begin your analysis, and add as many as you would like!","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false},"trusted":true,"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":149,"lastExecutedAt":1694143375616,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Use this cell to begin your analysis, and add as many as you would like!"},"id":"96436da5-af8e-4e65-8d6a-2531bb31b97b","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"import pandas as pd","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false},"trusted":true,"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":51,"lastExecutedAt":1694143375668,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd"},"id":"6c8a4c05-30ed-408c-b315-5f8bc06e9d42","cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"source":"apps=pd.read_csv(\"datasets/apps.csv\")\napps.info()\napps.head()","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"trusted":true,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":290,"type":"stream"}},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":228,"lastExecutedAt":1694143375897,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"apps=pd.read_csv(\"datasets/apps.csv\")\napps.info()\napps.head()"},"id":"381eebb5-b711-4230-9db0-2d79a551b7a2","cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 9659 entries, 0 to 9658\nData columns (total 9 columns):\n #   Column        Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------        --------------  -----  \n 0   App           9659 non-null   object \n 1   Category      9659 non-null   object \n 2   Rating        8196 non-null   float64\n 3   Reviews       9659 non-null   int64  \n 4   Size          8432 non-null   float64\n 5   Installs      9659 non-null   object \n 6   Type          9659 non-null   object \n 7   Price         9659 non-null   float64\n 8   Last Updated  9659 non-null   object \ndtypes: float64(3), int64(1), object(5)\nmemory usage: 679.3+ KB\n"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"App","type":"string"},{"name":"Category","type":"string"},{"name":"Rating","type":"number"},{"name":"Reviews","type":"integer"},{"name":"Size","type":"number"},{"name":"Installs","type":"string"},{"name":"Type","type":"string"},{"name":"Price","type":"number"},{"name":"Last Updated","type":"string"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":[{"index":0,"App":"Photo Editor & Candy Camera & Grid & ScrapBook","Category":"ART_AND_DESIGN","Rating":4.1,"Reviews":159,"Size":19,"Installs":"10,000+","Type":"Free","Price":0,"Last Updated":"January 7, 2018"},{"index":1,"App":"Coloring book moana","Category":"ART_AND_DESIGN","Rating":3.9,"Reviews":967,"Size":14,"Installs":"500,000+","Type":"Free","Price":0,"Last Updated":"January 15, 2018"},{"index":2,"App":"U Launcher Lite – FREE Live Cool Themes, Hide Apps","Category":"ART_AND_DESIGN","Rating":4.7,"Reviews":87510,"Size":8.7,"Installs":"5,000,000+","Type":"Free","Price":0,"Last Updated":"August 1, 2018"},{"index":3,"App":"Sketch - Draw & Paint","Category":"ART_AND_DESIGN","Rating":4.5,"Reviews":215644,"Size":25,"Installs":"50,000,000+","Type":"Free","Price":0,"Last Updated":"June 8, 2018"},{"index":4,"App":"Pixel Draw - Number Art Coloring Book","Category":"ART_AND_DESIGN","Rating":4.3,"Reviews":967,"Size":2.8,"Installs":"100,000+","Type":"Free","Price":0,"Last Updated":"June 20, 2018"}]},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                                 App  ...
